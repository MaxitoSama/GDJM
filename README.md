# Information about the game.
Ninja's Path
There are two types of controls.
For gameplay:
Left  			= "D"
Right 			= "A"
Slide 			= "S + A/D"
Jump  			= "Space"
Music Volume Up 	= "+"
Music Volume Down 	= "-"
Save  			= "F5"

For Testing:
First Scene     	= "F1"

We used the Save and Load buttons as a mechanic to be able to progress
through the game.
