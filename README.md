## Information about the game.
Ninja's Path
There are two types of controls.

For gameplay:
 - Left  			= "D"
 - Right 			= "A"
 - Slide 			= "S + A/D"
 - Jump  			= "Space"
 - Music Volume Up 		= "+"
 - Music Volume Down 		= "-"
 - Save  			= "F5"
 - Load				= "F6"

For Testing:
 - First Scene     		= "F1"
 - Start of Scene 		= "F2"
 - See Colliders 		= "F3"

We used the Save and Load buttons as a mechanic to be able to progress
through the game.
